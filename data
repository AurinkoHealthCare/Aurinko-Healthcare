It transports fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation and also buffers excess acetyl CoA away from mitochondria. Cynarin extract have hepato-protective effects. It inhibits the biosynthesis of hepato-cholesterol and improves the bile secretion. Choline acts as a lipotrophic substance. Choline and Methionine deficiency increases the risk of Fatty liver as their deficiency causes the synthesis of very-low-density-lipoproteins (VLDL).",
