      <p>
        Soil minerals are naturally occurring inorganic substances that are essential for plant growth and development. They play a crucial role in soil fertility, nutrient availability, and overall soil health.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of Soil Minerals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary minerals: These are the original minerals from which soils are formed, such as quartz, feldspar, and mica.</li>
        <li>Secondary minerals: These are formed from the weathering of primary minerals and include clay minerals, oxides, and carbonates.</li>
        <li>Nutrient minerals: These are essential for plant growth and include macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) and micronutrients (e.g., iron, manganese, zinc).</li>
      </ul>
